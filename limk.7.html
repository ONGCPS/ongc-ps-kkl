<li>Spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by NASA and redesigned for an alternate purpose.</li>
 <li>These technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated 
by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices.</li><li> These spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields
 including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more.</li><li> NASA publishes an annual report called "Spinoffs",
 regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put
 to use.</li><li> For example, in the most recent edition of this publication, "Spinoffs 2015", endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations 
of aerospace achievement.</li><li>This device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through 
a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization.</li><li> "These NASA technologies are not only giving companies and entrepreneurs
 a competitive edge in their own industries, but are also helping to shape budding industries, such as commercial lunar landers," said Daniel Lockney.</li>
