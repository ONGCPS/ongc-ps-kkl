<li>Functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment.</li><li> It implies that the system or equipment can be operated
 properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.</li>
<li>Functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence.</li><li> In this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the European
 Aviation Safety Agency (EASA ),[13] regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards.</li><li> This is meant to reach and ensure the highest 
possible level of safety.</li><li> The standards AS 9100 in America, EN 9100 on the European market or JISQ 9100 in Asia particularly address the aerospace and 
aviation industry.</li><li> These are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles.</li><li> Some companies are therefore specialized in the certification,
 inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.</li>
